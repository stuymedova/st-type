# ST-Type

The typography of arcade games was largely defined by the limitations of its medium â€” characters had to be designed to fit within an 8x8 pixel grid. The result, as games themselves, combined both functionality and simplicity, as well as playfulness.

ST-01 and ST-02 were inspired by the aesthetics of the arcade game typography implemented in high resolution for modern use.
