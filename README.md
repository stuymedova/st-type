# ST-Type

The typography of arcade games ([learn more↗](https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/arcade-game-typography/)) was largely defined by the limitations of its medium — characters had to be designed to fit within an 8x8 pixel grid. The result, as games themselves, combined both simplicity and rigidity, as well as playfulness.

ST-01 and ST-02 were inspired by the aesthetics of the arcade game typography implemented in high resolution for modern use. [Available on request↗](mailto:stuymedova@gmail.com)
